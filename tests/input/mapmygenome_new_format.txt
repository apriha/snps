# This file contains raw genotype data, including data that is not used in Mapmygenome reports.
# This data has undergone a general quality review, however only a subset of markers have been
# individually validated for accuracy. As such, this data is suitable only for research,
# educational and informational use, and not for medical or other use.
#
# Fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single SNP. For each SNP, we provide its
# identifier (rsid or internal id), location on the reference human genome, and genotype call
# oriented to plus strand on the human reference sequence. We are using human assembly build 37.
