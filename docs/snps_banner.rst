snps Banner
===========
The ``snps`` banner is composed of nucleotides from
`GRCh38 mitochondrial DNA <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_012920.1>`_. SNPs are
represented by lighter colored nucleotides.

The SVG file was modified from a version created with
`macSVG <https://github.com/dsward2/macsvg/>`_.

The PNG file was exported from `macSVG <https://github.com/dsward2/macsvg/>`_.

The color scheme was generated by `ColorBrewer <http://colorbrewer2.org/>`_.

SNPs
----
The SNPs highlighted in the banner were identified with the
`UCSC Genome Browser <https://genome.ucsc.edu/>`_. The dbSNP accessions for the SNPs are as
follows:
